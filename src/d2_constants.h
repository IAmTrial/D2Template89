*   This file is meant to declare various constant data. As you add more    *
*   custom code to your library, you will be using many constant values     *
*   used by the game's internal code. Unit types are a good example.        *
*   Declaring constants allows you to assign a name to these constants      *
*   which are more convenient to use in your source code.                   *
*                                                                           *
*   Another advantage is smaller impact in cases where these values would   *
*   need to change. Rather than revising every single piece of code using   *
*   this value, you only need to change your constant's value               *
*                                                                           *
